This actually encourages google to promote AI generated content with little substance over websites created by real people with useful information. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-opBifFfsMY">video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@acegikmo">Freya Holmï¿½r</a> shows the extent of the AI epidemic, they search "glb file format" and find almost every result to be ai generated, the image below, taken from the video highlights content that is definetely ai generated in red, content that may be ai in yellow, and does not highlight anything that is not ai generated, </p>
