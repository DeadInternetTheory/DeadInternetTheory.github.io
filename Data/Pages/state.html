        <h5 class="DetectInView FadeOnView" style="margin-top: 80vh;">In a study conducted by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/archive/bot-traffic-report-2016/?redirect=Incapsula">Imperva</a>, it was found that over 50% of internet activity is conducted via automated bots. Additionally, it is estimated that around <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yofi.ai/post/how-many-twitter-users-are-bots#:~:text=tl%3Bdr%3A%20we%20estimate%2024,as%20of%20May%2017%2C%202022">%30</a> of X (formerly Twitter) users are bots. It is very likely that you have interacted with many bots on social media without knowing it was a bot.</h5>

        <h3 class="Obfuscate DetectInView FadeOnView">Copyright</h3>
        <h6 class="DetectInView FadeOnView">Along side the issue of bots posting content, there are the human users of social media who post AI generated content for internet clout. People on social media may not be consuming content posted by AI, however everyone has most defintely read and consumed AI generated content online, whether it was a fake article or an uncanny AI generated image. Besides the issue of the content being low-effort and low-quality, there is also the legal issue of copyright where artists, and even ordinary internet commenters are having their own opinions, art, and hard-work, consumed by AI for training which raises the ethical and legal concern of shady big tech taking our human generated content to allow others to create low-effort content at the single click of a button. Help us stop this issue, <a target="_blank" href="../Pages/donate.html">donate</a> to us so we can prevent this from happening.</h6>

        <h3 class="Obfuscate DetectInView FadeOnView">Darker Issues</h3>
        <h6 class="DetectInView FadeOnView">Despite many internet users falling for bot posted, and AI generated content - particularily the elderly on facebook falling for AI images of MAGA political officials 'helping' the local community - there are some users who are well aware when talking to an AI chatbot, however see it as a way out from life. More disturbingly, there are some chatbot websites that claim to be stand-ins for actual friendships and therapy, so much so that when posed with the prompt of someone wanting to end their own lives, the AIs claim to be real humans and provide its suboptimal help.</h6>
        <br />
        <h6 class="DetectInView FadeOnView">In an article published on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced2ywg7246o">BBC</a>, a popular AI website called Character.AI has been responsible for the suicide of several young impressionable individuals. This only exarcebates the social media AI issue, people who are subjected to AI interaction are not only not actually interacting with anyone but sometimes recieving harmful advice. Controlling AI and preventing the dead internet also means preventing AIs from being used as a crutch and replacement for human interaction, alongside reducing bot and AI generated content on the internet and our beloved social medias.</h6>
