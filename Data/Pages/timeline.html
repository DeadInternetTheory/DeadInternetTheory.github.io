        <div class="TimelineItem DetectInView"><p style="width: 400px;" class="TimelineText DetectInView FadeOnView">The internet, a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks and electronic devices that communicate with each other using an established set of protocols, was first invented on the 1st of January, 1983, and became publicly available on the 30th of April, 1993. This accomplishment revolutionised the modern world, allowing for instant worldwide communication and interaction.</p></div>
        <div class="TimelineItem DetectInView"><p style="width: 280px;" class="TimelineText DetectInView FadeOnView">By 1988, the first Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bots were launched. These allowed for various functions to be automated such as managing user lists, performing searches, and providing services like weather updates and game scores.</p></div>
        <div class="TimelineItem DetectInView"><p style="width: 230px;" class="TimelineText DetectInView FadeOnView">In the mid-1990s, search engines like AltaVista and Yahoo! emerged, followed by Google in 1998. These transformed how users accessed and interacted with content, laying the foundation for modern web experiences.</p></div>
        <div class="TimelineItem DetectInView"><p style="width: 280px;" class="TimelineText DetectInView FadeOnView">Social media began to dominate the internet in the 2000s. Platforms like MySpace (2003), Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), and Twitter (2006) fundamentally changed how users generated and consumed content.</p></div>
        <div class="TimelineItem DetectInView"><p style="width: 220px;" class="TimelineText DetectInView FadeOnView">By the 2010s, the internet had become dominated by a few large platforms. Algorithms began heavily curating content, raising concerns about echo chambers, misinformation, and the decreasing visibility of independent creators.</p></div>
        <div class="TimelineItem DetectInView"><p style="width: 300px;" class="TimelineText DetectInView FadeOnView">The "Dead Internet Theory" began circulating around 2021. It posits that much of online content is now generated by AI, bots, or automated systems, rather than real human users, leading to a less authentic and more artificial online experience.</p></div>
        <div class="TimelineItem DetectInView"><p style="width: 240px;" class="TimelineText DetectInView FadeOnView">Critics of the Dead Internet Theory argue that while bots and automation have increased, there is still a vast amount of genuine human activity online. However, the growing use of AI-generated content raises real questions about digital authenticity.</p></div>
        <div class="TimelineItem DetectInView"><p style="width: 340px;" class="TimelineText DetectInView FadeOnView">The public release of ChatGPT 3.5 on the 30th of November 2022 showed the world that AI chatbots can replicate human speech to a terrifyingly accurate degree, developments in this technology only continued further and many public AIs today are almost indistinguishable from Human speech..</p></div>
        <div class="TimelineItem DetectInView"><p style="width: 200px;" class="TimelineText DetectInView FadeOnView">As of the mid-2020s, discussions around internet authenticity, censorship, bot activity, and algorithmic manipulation remain central to debates about the future of the web and digital public discourse.</p></div>
