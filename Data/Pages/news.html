            <p>
                DIT is proud to announce our newest and most volatile partnership to date: a collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="https://dipasarswalayan.github.io/">Genord Motors</a>, the only car company bold enough to power its vehicles with lab rats and pure audacity. Known for its ethically ambiguous R&D and unsettlingly charismatic CEO, Genord has captured our attention—not through innovation alone, but by existing at the absurd crossroads of techno-utopianism, bio-electric absurdity, and the kind of PR disasters that feel suspiciously algorithm-generated.
                <br><br>
                Why would a digital watchdog platform align with a car manufacturer that refers to its own safety standards as “optional”? The answer lies deep in the glitch-riddled fabric of the modern web. Genord’s entire public image, from its “seatbeltless” Model F to CEO Linda Varn’s philosophical rat debates, feels less like corporate strategy and more like a procedurally generated simulation left unchecked. We at DIT suspect Genord may not just be innovating new forms of power, but unintentionally exposing the mechanics of a world where reality and satire blur—an ecosystem where marketing, memes, and morality collapse into content churn.
                <br><br>
                Our role in this partnership? Observation, documentation, and mild encouragement. We’re embedding DIT researchers into Genord’s marketing backend to analyze how their outrageous public messaging survives—and thrives—on modern platforms. Are they manipulating engagement algorithms, or are they simply a natural byproduct of the dead internet’s content void? Either way, the partnership gives us unprecedented access to one of the internet’s most bizarre corporate actors.
                <br><br>
                As Genord prepares to unveil new models (and potentially new species), DIT will continue to ask the difficult questions: Is this real? Should it be? And most importantly, how did this get past regulation?
                <br><br>
                To allow us to further our partnership, and help out both our companies and further the cause to attain real human content online, please <a target="_blank" href="../Pages/donate.html">donate</a> so we can achieve our ultimate goal.

                We have interviewed a fellow World Wide Web enjoyer about his thoughts on the Dead Internet Theory. Mary Andrew Dave stated that “[he] has places to be, and [I] can not keep [him] here forever”. This statement was accentuated with aggressive hand gestures and enraged facial expressions. He then furiously encourages me to hasten my typing speed to decrease the time in which this interview takes. When asked what Mary Andrew Dave believes the Dead Internet Theory is, he states that the entire internet is run by bots, unfortunately he has little idea of what this theory means. He also believes that this theory is inaccurate, believing that there can’t be that many bots controlling the status of the World Wide Web. He then states that he believes the internet may be mostly run by bots, slightly over 50% of internet traffic. To my dismay, he only stated this after a team member with the data yells out the answer. Mary decides that this fact makes him apprehensive, feeling as if he is given no sense of privacy or choice in what he wishes to say within this interview. He feels unsafe using the internet due to the immense number of bots. He believes that in the future, this issue will only get worse as the internet is further overtaken by bot activity, increasing the bot to human ratio significantly.
                <br><br>
                We have also interviewed a second kind individual, John Athan Pork. She began this interview by respectfully judging the interviewer, myself. She swiftly determined that I suck, thank you John. When queried on the meaning of the Dead Internet Theory, John correctly stated that it meant everyone who types on the internet is a passed spirit. She believes that 140% of internet users are these spirits. We believe John was previously knowledgeable on this topic. She tells us that this theory must be accurate, because her dad perished a few days prior to the interview time, and she caught him typing on the internet after his passing. She feels worried about the future of the internet as she believes these spirits are inferior to the human race and are here to take our jobs and money. She strongly suggests they should travel back to their place of origin, located within the underworld. Before the interview concluded, Miss Pork informs us of the presence of government drones in the form of birds.

                A third interviewer joined us today. Tomathan Cruise Cruise the XCII opens the interview with frantic statements about his lack of knowledge of how he was transported to the interview destination. He then states he is unsure of what the interview is about. When questioned on the Dead Internet Theory, Tomathan states that it means there are a bunch of bots in the internet, and they are dead. He also correctly identifies that it is a theory. After I comment on him being the first interviewee to not insult me, he tells me that he believes that this theory is more accurate than my handwriting, despite me clearly typing on a laptop. Mr. XCII estimates that 55.000000000% of internet traffic is made up of bots. I believe he encountered a floating-point precision error with this statistic. When asked how he feels about this statistic, he misunderstands the question for approximately 7 minutes, before stating that he feels as if he is Tom Cruise. To conclude the third and final interview, Cruise states he would like to mention Tuesday the 3rd of June, and the phrase “great job guys”.
