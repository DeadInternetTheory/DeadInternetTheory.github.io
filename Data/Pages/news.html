        <h1>Parner: Genord Motors</h1>
        <hr />
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://dipasarswalayan.github.io/">Genord Motors</a> has long been an inspiration for us at Bonkers Inc. They paved the way forward in the usage of rats, as opposed to chinese children, for cheap labour, leaving the chinese children to have a real childhood rather than slaving away in a factory. Genord has inspired us to use rats from the same trusted supplier, the rat supplier, to create real content for the internet, if you want to help us afford all the rats we will need you can donate to the cause <a href="donate.html">here</a> and help to make the internet real again</p>
