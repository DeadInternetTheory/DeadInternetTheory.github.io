        <p>
            Donating helps us take a stand against the growing wave of artificial, soulless content polluting the internet. Every contribution supports our efforts to bring back genuine human expression, critical thinking, and community engagement. With enough support, we can push back against the algorithm-driven noise and make space for real people again.
            The internet used to be a vibrant place of human creativity, discussion, and discovery. Now, much of what we see is mass-produced by bots or generated by AI with no real purpose or soul. This isn't just annoying—it's eroding trust, promoting misinformation, and silencing authentic voices. Your donation helps us fight to restore the internet as a space where people—not machines—set the tone.
            We’re building a campaign to raise awareness and pressure lawmakers to take real action. Our goal is to work with digital rights organizations, ethical technologists, and policy experts to propose legislation that mandates clear labeling of AI-generated content, enforces transparency on major platforms, and sets strict boundaries for synthetic media. We will advocate for public hearings, collaborate with watchdog groups, and mobilize voters to demand a cleaner, more human internet—one that reflects our shared values, not just optimized engagement metrics.
